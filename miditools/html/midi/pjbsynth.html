<h3><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h3>
<p>This <em>csound</em> script takes MIDI input and produces audio output.
It is still at an early release stage, and is likely to change
even in important details like Patches and Controller-numbers.</p>
<p>Channels 0-8 are dedicated to Audio signals.
The basic Patches are simple, old-fashioned waveforms
like sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth,
plus some fractal waveforms, and also live or file audio.</p>
<p>The Channel Controllers for these Audio channels
can be set by the normal methods,
or one or two of them can be driven by a built-in Low-Frequency-Oscillator
by using the non-standard controllers cc20 to cc23, or cc24 to cc27,
or by a built-in Attack-Envelope using cc52 to cc53.
Other non-standard controllers offer also
Ring modulation, Distortion, some unusual types of Loop, etc.</p>
<p>Channel 9 is dedicated to a low-tech percussion-set
using simple waveforms like sine or white noise.
It is roughly modelled on General-MIDI Channel 9,
see <a href="http://www.pjb.com.au/muscript/gm.html#perc">http://www.pjb.com.au/muscript/gm.html#perc</a></p>
<p>Channels 10-15 are dedicated to the Low-Frequency-Oscillators,
where MIDI-note number 60 means not middle-C,
but 1 Cycle-per-second (i.e. eight octaves lower!).</p>
<p>An example <em>setup1.mid</em> is included,
which sets up <em>pjbsynth</em> with a few plausible sounds.</p>

<p>The Low-Frequency-Oscillators live in Channels 10 and above,
and use Patches 100 and above.
Their frequencies are eight octaves lower than the audio Patches,
so that Note number 60 means 1 cycle-per-second.
These two data-items, the Patch and the &quot;Note&quot;,
are the only two that Low-Frequency-Oscillators need.</p>

<h3><a name="non_standard_controller_numbers">NON-STANDARD CONTROLLER-NUMBERS</a></h3>
<p>cc20-23 connect a controller (cc21) to an LFO (cc20),
and cc24-27 connect another controller (cc25) to an LFO (cc24).
Similarly, cc52-55 connect a controller (cc53)
to an Effect-Envelope launched at the start of each note
(which also affects other notes ongoing in the same Channel).</p>
<p>When being driven by an LFO or an Effect-Envelope in this way,
the controller will ignore its standard MIDI Controller-Change commands.</p>
<p>If in one channel cc21 and cc25 both attempt to connect the same controller
(this would be an error) then the cc20-cc23 specification takes precedence.
But multiple controllers in many channels may be driven by the same LFO
without problem.</p>
<pre>
 20 = LFO-channel (10..15; default 0=off)
 21 = an audio Channel-Controller that the LFO will control
      (cc21=0 is special-cased to mean Pitch-Bend)
 22 = the minimum value of that audio Channel-Controller
 23 = the maximum value of that audio Channel-Controller</pre>
<pre>
 24 = LFO-channel (10..15; default 0=off)
 25 = another audio Channel-Controller that this new LFO will control
      (cc25=0 is special-cased to mean Pitch-Bend)
 26 = the minimum value of that audio Channel-Controller
 27 = the maximum value of that audio Channel-Controller</pre>
<pre>
 52 = Effect-Envelope Attack-Time (0..127; default 0=off)
 53 = the audio Channel-Controller that this Effect-Envelope will control
      (cc53=0 is special-cased to mean Pitch-Bend)
 54 = the initial value of that audio Channel-Controller
 55 = the  final  value of that audio Channel-Controller</pre>
<p>There are several other non-standard CC's:</p>
<pre>
  14 = Choof (unimplemented)
  15 = Clonk (unimplemented)
  44 = Loop Type (0=Echo (default), 1=Loop, 2=Rabbit, 3=Morse-Thue)
  45 = Loop Volume
  46 = Loop Delay 1 (0..4 sec)
  47 = Loop Delay 2
  87 = Overdrive Distortion (modelled on SWH foverdrive_1196)
  88 = Ring Modulator Channel (usually set to Patch 0)
  90 = Tremolo rate (affects the cc92 tremolo)
 119 = Dump current settings to pjbsynth.state.py (unimplemented)
       will use subinstr, srtcatk, fprintks to print non-default gkCC*
       in either muscript, MIDI-Perl, MIDI.py, MIDI.lua, or .mid format</pre>
<p>If cc87=0 then Distortion is switched off.</p>
<p>If cc88=127 then Ring-Modulation is switched off.
If cc88 points to another audio channel (0..8) then
the latter's direct output will be suppressed
and the current channel will be modulated with it.
Usually, that other channel should be a simple wave-form like a sine,
perhaps with portamento.</p>

<h3><a name="installation">INSTALLATION</a></h3>
<p>For a full installation, download the tarball:
<a href="http://www.pjb.com.au/midi/free/pjbsynth-1.22.tar.gz">http://www.pjb.com.au/midi/free/pjbsynth-1.22.tar.gz</a> ,
unpack it, and, as superuser: <em>make install</em> .
This puts some files in <em>/usr/local/share/pjbsynth/</em>
and copies a wrapper script to <em>/usr/local/bin/pjbsynth</em></p>
<p>For a minimal installation, unpack the tarball and
copy <em>pjbsynth.csd</em> and the <em>*.txt</em> files into your working directory.</p>
<p>See the SYNOPSIS for the difference in usage.</p>
<p>You will also need <em>csound</em> version 5 installed.</p>
<p>

<pre>

 20101211      disentangled cc53=0 (Bend) from the other cc53 settings
 20101210 1.13 stereo phaser, cc52-55 allow attack-Envelope control
 20101202 1.12 Ring modulator, Distortion, Patch 91
 20101127 1.11 first uploaded to www.pjb.com.au
 20101110 1.10 first working version</pre>
<pre>
 TODO:
  Choof CC using perhaps very mildly filtered pink noise
  Clonk CC using very heavily damped sine at perhaps sqrt of note-pitch
  Note=0 guaranteed silent (used to force a reread of Loop parameters)
  MT and Rabbit CC somehow (two delay params), not just boring old Loop
   (won't need Loop, MT and Rabbit simultaneously; how to express this?)
  A filtered pink-noise patch
  Stereo live audio through, patch 90
  State dump
  Give the Reverb an initial delay, somehow increasing with the reverb time</pre>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h3><a name="bugs">BUGS</a></h3>
<p>The <em>phaser2</em> function needs a fast CPU,
especially if several phasers are running simultaneously.</p>
<p>The Registered-parameter controllers cc101 and cc100
are handled by <em>csound</em> in some apparently undocumented way.
<em>pjbsynth</em> treats a naked cc6 event as setting the Pitch-bend-range,
but if you send a cc101 and cc100 first (like you're supposed to)
then cc6 produces no effect.</p>
<p>Changes in controller cc45 go unnoticed
until a new note is struck in the channel;
this is inconvenient if a loop is running and you want to fade it out...</p>
