# >> Придумай песню на английском про: казать спустя рождаться, что с горки кататься.
# << Verse 1:
# Born into the world with a clean slate
# Learning to crawl before we can walk straight
# Gotta go through the struggles and the falls
# How else do we learn to stand up tall

# Chorus:
# Rolling down the hill of life
# Ups and downs, the joy and strife
# We learn to laugh and we learn to cry
# But we keep on rolling till we touch the sky

# Verse 2:
# Sometimes we fall and it hurts like hell
# But we gotta pick ourselves up and break the spell
# The bruises will heal and the scars will fade
# But the lessons we learn will never be betrayed

# Chorus:
# Rolling down the hill of life
# Ups and downs, the joy and strife
# We learn to laugh and we learn to cry
# But we keep on rolling till we touch the sky

# Bridge:
# Life may seem like a rollercoaster ride
# But we gotta keep moving and take it in our stride
# The journey is long but the destination's worth the wait
# So let's keep on rolling, don't wanna be late

# Chorus:
# Rolling down the hill of life
# Ups and downs, the joy and strife
# We learn to laugh and we learn to cry
# But we keep on rolling till we touch the sky

# Outro:
# Rolling, rolling, rolling, we won't give up
# Rolling, rolling, rolling, till we reach the top
# Rolling, rolling, rolling, life is a ride
# Keep on rolling, let your heart guide.
